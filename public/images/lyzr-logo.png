[BINARY IMAGE FILE CONTENT]

Note: This is a placeholder for the binary content of the Lyzr logo PNG file. The actual implementation requires:

1. Obtaining the Lyzr logo image file (lyzr-logo.png)
2. Placing it in the public/images directory
3. Ensuring the image is properly formatted as a PNG file

The binary content cannot be directly represented in text format.
